# Hash to number
 opens a CSV file contain a name and a hash num after that, and print the number.  can change the number range (defult is 10000)

 i added a CSV example ; you can just add sume name and hashed numbers and get the number for each name.


 also if your number isnt in range(0-10000) , you can change the range in line-9.

 also again, when you created your CSV file , you should change the file location to your new file location in line-13.

 i hope you enjoy it :)
